# CS-305

As part of a vulnerability assessment for Artemis Financial, a mid-sized financial institution, I conducted an in-depth analysis of their software infrastructure to identify and mitigate any potential security vulnerabilities. During the process, I utilized techniques such as penetration testing and code review to meticulously scrutinize potential attack vectors and uncover various vulnerabilities. I believe that focusing on details is crucial because coding securely is essential in preventing exploitation by malicious actors and maintaining customer trust. Ensuring software security is of utmost importance as it protects sensitive data, financial assets, and reputation, ultimately contributing to the company's overall wellbeing. However, there were challenges along the way, such as balancing thoroughness with efficiency, which was a delicate task. Nonetheless, this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience that enhanced my skills in real-world security assessments. Going forward, I plan to leverage OWASP along with its guidelines and tools to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation strategies. After refactoring, I thoroughly tested the code to ensure both functionality and security, utilizing OWASP resources for guidance and validation. The practices and resources provided by OWASP throughout this assignment are invaluable for future tasks. Vulnerability assessment reports and documentation on implemented security practices would serve as compelling evidence of my expertise in ensuring the security and integrity of software systems, positioning me as a valuable asset in the cybersecurity or software development domain for potential employers.
